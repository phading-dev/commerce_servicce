## Pricing

### Storage

$0.025 per GB per month, charged to publishers.

### One-time upload

$0.02 per GB, charged to publishers.

### Network cost

$0.1 per GB. E.g. a 4k video whose size is 15 GB with 1 hour long playback duration, costs $0.1 x 15 GB x 1 hour = $1.5 if a user watches for the full hour. Likely, a 720P video whose size is 1G with 1 hour long playback duration, costs $0.1 x 1 GB x 1 hour = $0.1. The cost is deducted from the amount consumers payed.

### Show

Base price is $0.1 per hour, charged to consumers. After the network cost and 10% cut, the rest are payed out to. Rounded up.

Final amount is base price multiplied by watch hours and by grade which can be from 1 to 100.

Note that if a video's size is too large whose network cost is higher than what consumers will pay, e.g. a 4k video with grade 1 pricing, the video should not be uploaded/served.
